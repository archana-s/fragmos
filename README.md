-------

Stable version: 0.5.3

Fragmos is a styleguide template with PostCSS and CSS4 feature sets.

## Getting started

This project uses [Node](https://nodejs.org) and [NPM](https://npmjs.org) to
install dependencies and run the project. You will need both of these installed
in order to start up the server.

Once you have the above dependencies, clone this project using:

```
git clone https://github.com/archana-s/fragmos
```

And then enter the directory with:

```
cd fragmos
```

From here you can install the dependencies using NPM:

```
npm install
```

Once this completes, you can run the server with:

```
npm start
```

This will echo out a link that you can paste into your browser and view
the styleguide and demo.
